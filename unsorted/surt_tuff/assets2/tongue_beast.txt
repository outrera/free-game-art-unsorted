'pixelized' version of one of surt's CC0 Scraps (https://opengameart.org/forumtopic/cc0-scraps)... didn't know what to call it so this is what you get.

Anyway, this is a scaled, color reduced variant of Surt's original work hand tweaked to give it a 'pixel art' look. It's basically cheating but the results look pretty good and are very servicable for monster artwork in games like Phantasy Star (and probably many others).
