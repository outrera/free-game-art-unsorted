Hi! I'm Davit Masia, I create a lot of graphics for fun, mockups,etc... that usually ends lost on my folders. So i decided upload and share with everybody all that stuff so people can use in their projects. Assets are free but any donation will be welcomed and motivate me to add more and more!. Also you can support me on patreon https://www.patreon.com/davitmasia

What license?
You can use the assets for your personal/commercial games without need of credit back, but if you do that, and this means, add a link in your project to this site, i will share your creations on my social networks like twitter, tumblr, twitch or hitbox and also at the end of this page as example of games created with my assets. Quid pro quo! Cool right?. 

There are a few things that are not allowed:
- You can't upload my assets to other site.
- You can't sell the assets as yours. Is obvious but better be clear.
- You can't sell t-shirts and similar with my designs. I'm already doing that.

If you have any doubt, please give me a touch on twitter.
